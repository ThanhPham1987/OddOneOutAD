## ðŸŒ€ Our Multi-object AD vs Previous Works

<table>
    <tr>
    <td><img src="figures/SAD.jpg" width="800"/></td>
    <td>The input is usually an image of single object. Here, anomalies are instance-specific.
      <ul>
        <li></li> 
        <li>This setting suffers from <b>ambiguous</b> definition of regularity (e.g., both cups in the example can be either normal or anomalous based on what the manufacturer wants to produce).</li>
        <li>To resolve the ambiguity an explicit specification of regularity is required to provide (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/VICO-UoE/Looking3D">Looking3D</a>).</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="figures/MAD.jpg" width="800"/></td>
      <td>The input of the framework is a set of sparse view images of a scene containing multiple objects. We aim to detect 'odd-looking' objects that contain manufacturing errors (e.g., different geometry, texture) or damages (e.g., cracks, fractures). Here, anomalies are scene-specific.
      <ul>
        <li>In contrast to earlier setting, our multi-object AD does not require explicit specification of regularity. The majority of objects are normal and serve as a reference for regularity<./li>
        <li>This is specially useful in quality control in bulk production.</li>
      </ul>
